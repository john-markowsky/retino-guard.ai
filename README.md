# Retino Guard AI: Decision Support System for Diabetic Retinopathy Prevention

## Introduction
Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is an extremely serious but all too common complication of diabetes mellitus which causes blindness. “Diabetic retinopathy is the most frequently occurring complication of diabetes mellitus and remains a leading cause of vision loss globally. Its etiology and pathology have been extensively studied for half a century, yet there are disappointingly few therapeutic options.”(Stitt et al., 2016). Early detection and proper management of diabetic retinopathy can reduce the possibility of vision loss, but with current methods, diabetic retinopathy is difficult to diagnose early. With the rate of diabetes climbing yearly, there is a pressing need for an intelligent system to support healthcare providers in detecting and managing diabetic retinopathy.

## Project Aims
The goal of this project is to develop a system which helps diagnose and predict the risk of diabetic retinopathy, allowing for earlier intervention and treatment to combat blindness. Our Retino Guard AI system will be trained on the Diabetic Retinopathy Debrecen Data Set to classify the images and determine the severity of retinopathy. We aim to produce a device which accurately assists healthcare professionals detect and prevent diabetic retinopathy via early diagnosis.

## Methods
The AI methods that will be used in this will both be from the supervised learning category; Support Vector Machines and Artificial Neural Networks. "Neural network applications in computer-aided diagnosis represent the main stream of computational intelligence in medical imaging. Their penetration and involvement are almost comprehensive for all medical problems due to the fact that neural networks have the nature of adaptive learning from input information"(Jiang et al., 2010). Because of their specialized abilities in both classification and image recognition, these techniques will be used to train the Decision Support System (DSS) to classify by severity the images contained in the dataset. 

## Sources
The knowledge, documents, and data required for this project is found on the Kaggle’s APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection Competition Data Set. Kaggle is an online community platform for data scientists and machine learning enthusiasts. It hosts the dataset which includes over 115,000 images which will be used to train our system.

## Clients
The clients we intend to serve are healthcare professionals, especially ophthalmologists and optometrists who are involved in the diagnosis and treatment of diabetic retinopathy patients. We imagine that clinics and hospitals which specialize in treating diabetic patients might also show interest as stakeholders in the Retino Guard AI project.

## Tools
The main programming language that will be used for this project is python. Several libraries that exist in python will serve as tools to help us train our system including; TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV. TensorFlow is an open source library for machine learning and deep learning that can be utilized for training and testing the DSS. Keras is a high level neural network API that will be used to build the Artificial Neural Network model. OpenCV is a library used for real-time computer vision that will be used for processing images in the dataset.

## Conclusion
The proposed Retino Guard AI project will contribute with detection and prevention of diabetes retinopathy, providing healthcare professionals with a Decision Support System trained on a large dataset of retinal images. Not only does the project sync with course objectives, with the rise of diabetes worldwide, we believe it will be a valuable tool for healthcare providers around the globe.
